# 🎓 College Admission Agent (RAG-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **College Admission Agent** is an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline the student admission process.  
Built with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and powered by **IBM Cloud & IBM Granite Models**, this agent retrieves and summarizes admission policies, eligibility criteria, FAQs, and deadlines from trusted institutional sources.  

Prospective students can ask **natural language questions** and receive **accurate, real-time responses** on:
- Course selection  
- Application guidance  
- Fee structure  
- Important deadlines  

This project was developed as part of the **IBM Hackathon** challenge.
